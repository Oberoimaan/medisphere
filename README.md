# WE-Project-Disease-Predictor
### A web application to predicts the disease based on the symptoms given by the user and suggesting the treatments to deal with the predicted disease.
* We predict the disease if the patient is not in danger and the user simply wants to know what disease he or she might have.
* The dataset consisting of at least 100 symptoms, is used to train the model to predict various diseases.

<a id="features"></a>
## üöÄ Features
- The user is required to register with the system, in order to access the features of the web application.
- The disease is predicted using the algorithm(Decision Tree Classifier) and the user has to enter the symptoms from the given drop-down menu.
- The web application suggests treatments through a chat-bot(Medibot) that is meant to deal with the prognosis and some relevant information about the same.
- [Add more features](#feature-request)...

<a id="learning"></a>
## üí° Learnings
- Enhancing designing and graphic skills by accomodating javascript bootstrap library.
- Incorporating on scroll triggers for different elements using javascript and CSS.
- Integrating machine learning model with the web application.
- Creating and retrieving data of the user from the database.
- Implementing dialogflow bot into our web application with the help of kommunicate.

<a id="challenges"></a>
## üí° Challenges faced
- Had technical setup issue related to sklearn library while developing the project.
- Gathering dataset for the diseases and their treatment.
- DiÔ¨Äiculty with model building for disease prediction and integrating it with the web application.
- Model is not able to suggest the treatment for the predicted disease.
- Faced problem while gathering illsutrations and graphical representation for the related content of the website.

<a id="scope"></a>
## üöß Future Scope/ What's next?

- [ ] Implementing disease prediction using symptoms through Whatsapp using API calls.
- [ ] The model will not only predicts the disease but also suggests specialization that is meant to deal with the treatement.
- [ ] To maintain the history of the predicted disease of the user.
- [ ] Seeking online medical help via a calling feature and proving information of nearby healthcare center to the user.
- [ ] Make website responsive for multiple devices and develop mobile application for the same.
